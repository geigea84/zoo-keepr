/* 1.5 There are two important takeaways from this code:

The first is that the get() method requires two arguments. 
The first is a string that describes the route the client 
will have to fetch from. The second is a callback function 
that will execute every time that route is accessed with 
a GET request.

The second takeaway is that we are using the send() method 
from the res parameter (short for response) to send the 
string Hello! to our client. */
